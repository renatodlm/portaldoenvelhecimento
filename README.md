### Setup

To start using all the tools that come with `_s`  you need to install the necessary Node.js and Composer dependencies :

```sh
$ npm install
```

### Available CLI commands

```sh
$ npm start
```

Now you're ready to go! The next step is easy to say, but harder to do: make an awesome WordPress theme. :)

Good luck!
